An OSC library for Arduino using the WiFly RN-XV Wifi Module (or anything else with a Serial interface and packet send by timeout functionality).
No longer depends on any Wifly Library, but needs the Wifly to be configured before use. The Example in MinimalWiflyConfig does the job.

Tested with a WiFly RN-XV from Roving Networks.

 2015/01/22	version 1.0	Based on ArdOSC version 2.1 by recotana (Thanks a lot for you work!).
